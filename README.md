# 📊 Sales Strategy Experiment: Revenue Impact Analysis
## 📌 Business Context

Pens and Printers launched a new line of office stationery products and tested three different sales outreach strategies to determine which approach generated the highest revenue while considering team effort.

The three strategies tested were:

Email – Automated email campaign (low effort)

Call – 30-minute direct phone call per customer (high effort)

Email + Call – Email followed by a 10-minute call (moderate effort)

The objective was to evaluate performance and recommend the most effective and efficient sales strategy.
